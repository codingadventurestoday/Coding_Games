# Coding_Games

About
This Repo is all about building fun games for my niece and nephews to play! The hope is that these games spark an interest in learning ther very basics of coding or how computers actually work 

Background
Growing up in the early 2000s computers and gaming systems were just becoming common place. I remember playing Backyard Baseball at home and watching my brothers play Diablo 3. It was so much fun getting completely immersed in this worlds. As I grew up I spent hours playing MADDEN and the Elder Scroll games. My friends and I killed so many Nazi's in COD Zombies. 

I started coding at the start of 2022. I am sure you have a similar experience, coding has opened up a whole new world to me. Now when I go back and play video games I have such an amazing appriecation for the skills of the team who make these games come alive. Much like the appreication for atist after I make an terriable attempt at paitning during a date night. 

I hope these games can lead to my niece and nephews learn the basics of coding and eventually gaining an appreication for the technology that will shape the wolrd they grow up in. Curiousity is a fun way to live life!
